# Glossary 

## General Terms 

**Reference**: References allow you to link a value to another object's value such that updating the "referenced" value updates the linked value simultaneously. References are especially useful when trying to avoid duplication of work, since objects in Stoplight can be re-used multiple times. References can be created for objects in the current project, another project, or even by external URL

**Headers**: Carries information between a client and a server during a Request or a Response

**minLength**: An attribute used to constrain the length of a string. The length of a string instance must not be less that the minLength when used 

**maxLength**: The length of a string instance must not exceed maxLength when used 

**Pattern**: Indicates that a string should be a valid regular expression

**Allow empty value**: Indicates if an empty value is acceptable

**Enum**: List of allowed values 

**Body**: Data transferred in HTTP message following the Header

**Validation**: A linter that checks the accuracy of JSON files and/or data

**API key**: A special token used to indicate the origin of a request 

**Metadata**: Data that describes and gives information about data

**String**: Double-quoted Unicode characters

**Array**: An ordered sequence of values

**Object**: An unordered collection of key-value pairs. Objects in JSON are surrounded by curly braces {}

**Integer**: Digits from 0-9. Can be negative or positive

**Boolean**: True or False 

**Null**: A data type that indicates an empty value. Supported by JSON

**Response Codes**: Otherwise known as 'HTTP status codes', these are issued by a server in response to a client's request made to the server

### Authorization 

**Basic Auth**: An authentication scheme that utilizes HTTP headers to validate API consumers. Utilizes Base64 encoding 

**Digest Auth**: Similar to Basic Authentication, but applies a hash function to encrypt the username and password before sending them over the network

**OAuth 1.0**: OAuth 1.0 makes use of digital signatures to authenticate and ensure the data originates from an expected source. It can be used with or without SSL

**OAuth 2.0**: OAuth 2.0 authentication scheme expands upon 1.0 with a concentration on bearer tokens. It works with HTTPS/SSL for its security requirements

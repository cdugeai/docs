# Creating and Managing Access Tokens 

![Stoplight Access Tokens](https://github.com/stoplightio/docs/blob/develop/assets/imagesv2/access-tokens.png?raw=true)

## What 
Use tokens to access the Stoplight API, authenticate Prism in a continuous integration environment, and git close projects to your computer. 

## How 

1. Log into Stoplight 
2. Select **Settings** 
3. Select **Access Tokens**
4. Input a unique name into the text field 
5. Copy the first token to authenticate with the Stoplight API and Prism  
6. Copy the second token to [git clone projects to your computer](/platform/projects/git-repo) 

> Save your access tokens in a secure location - you won’t be able to see them again

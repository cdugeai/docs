# 301 Redirects for Published Hubs 

![301 Redirects](https://github.com/stoplightio/docs/blob/develop/assets/imagesv2/redirect.png?raw=true)

## What
You can now add redirects in your Published Hubs! If you change or remove a page route but still have links pointing to the old route, just create a redirect and your users will be routed to the correct place. 301 redirects also benefit SEO by telling search engines to de-index the old URL and indexing the new URL. You can add redirects now by navigating to the publish panel.

## How 
1. Select the **Project** you would like to modify 
2. Click the **Publishing icon** on the left-hand toolbar 
3. Select **Redirects** from within the Publishing Panel 
4. Click **Add** to add a redirect 
5. Input the originating **URL** and its destination

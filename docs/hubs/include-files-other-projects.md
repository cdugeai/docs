# Referencing Files From Other Projects

## What

You can include files from other Stoplight projects in your documentation. You can reference the following file types:

- YAML files, such as modeling files.
- Markdown and HTML files

## How

1. Go to the project containing the file you want to include.
2. Select the arrow button next to the filename. The exported version of the file opens in a new tab.

3. Copy the URL of the exported version.
4. Paste the URL as the target URL for a page in your project. See [Referencing Other Data Sources](/documentation/referencing-other-data-sources) for more information.

# Making your Endpoints Public/Private 

![Public and Private Endpoints](https://github.com/stoplightio/docs/blob/develop/assets/imagesv2/private-toggle.png?raw=true)

## What 
If you have endpoints that you don’t wish to expose publicly, you can make your endpoints private. This will remove them from any documentation you publish. 

>Note: This functionality wasn’t added to models ([how to hide models](https://docs.stoplight.io/documentation/hiding-models)) and doesn’t remove endpoints from your OpenAPI Specification document (if a download link is included or the specification is exported then they will be visible).

## How 
1. Select the **modeling file** you wish to modify 
2. Select the **endpoint** you would like to modify
3. Toggle **private** to on

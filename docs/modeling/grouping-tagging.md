# Grouping & Tagging Endpoints in OpenAPI

![Tagging and Grouping Endpoints](https://github.com/stoplightio/docs/blob/develop/assets/imagesv2/tagging-grouping.png?raw=true)

## What

Use tags to group API endpoints and provide an additional layer of organization in your OpenAPI files. When rendering your OpenAPI in read view, Stoplight will group API endpoints by their first tag.

## How

1. Click **Tag** within an endpoint's **Basic** Settings 
2. Input a **Name** 
3. Input a **Tag description** (optional) 
4. Switch to read view and you should see the endpoint grouped under that tag in the sidebar
